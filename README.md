# Database Project â€“ Multi-Milestone Team Assignment

> **Course:** DB2  
> **Goal:** Design and implement a fully-featured Oracle database in a two-person team, evolving from conceptual modeling to optimization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project follows eight milestones to build a realistic, large-scale database system.  
Each milestone expands the database and demonstrates specific skillsâ€”starting with entity-relationship modeling and ending with advanced performance tuning.

Team members work in parallel:
- **Student 1 (S1):** Focus on many-to-many relationships with an intermediate entity.
- **Student 2 (S2):** Focus on a two-level parentâ€“child hierarchy with cross-links.

## ðŸš€ Milestones Summary
| Milestone | Focus                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **M1**    | Team setup, unique topic selection, initial conceptual ER model in IntelliJ.            |
| **M2**    | Complete top-down design, apply normalization (0â€“3 NF), integrate S1 & S2 models.       |
| **M3**    | Create Oracle database, insert realistic test data, write complex join queries.         |
| **M4**    | PL/SQL packages with procedures/functions to empty and repopulate tables automatically. |
| **M5**    | Randomized data generation using collections, logging, and timestamps.                  |
| **M6**    | Bulk operations (`FORALL`, etc.) and performance comparison vs. single-row inserts.     |
| **M7**    | Documentation and grouping of all package functions with timing analysis.               |
| **M8**    | Advanced optimization: S1 partitions a large table; S2 creates a materialized view.     |
